Go to File → Project Structure → Project:



Project SDK: Java 17



Compiler Output: ./out (or your desired build folder)



### Step 3: Setup Database

Create a new MySQL database.



Import the SQL schema/tables:



SOURCE /path/to/schema.sql;

Update your DatabaseUtil.java:



String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your\_database";

String user = "your\_username";

String password = "your\_password";

### Step 4: Configure Email

If using Gmail:



Go to Google App Passwords



Generate an app password for your Gmail account



Replace this in EmailSender.java:



String senderEmail = "your\_email@gmail.com";

String senderPassword = "your\_app\_password";

## 🧪 Sample Workflow

Register as Teacher or Student



Login → Teacher creates batch



Teacher adds questions



Teacher creates quiz (select topic, difficulty)



Teacher assigns quiz to batch



Quiz PDF is auto-generated and emailed to students



All activities logged, and emails validated



🧵 Multi-threading \& Responsiveness

Swing UI actions like email sending or PDF generation are handled in separate threads using:



new Thread(() -> {

&nbsp;   // email or PDF task

}).start();

## ❗ Troubleshooting

Issue	Solution

Email not sent	Check app password and SMTP settings

FileNotFoundException on PDF	Make sure the PDFs directory exists before writing

Invalid recipient address error	Ensure the email is in correct format and domain exists

Auth error 535-5.7.8	Use App Passwords
